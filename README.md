A quick and dirty tool built using Python. This tool is intended to be used to help the Great Raxxla Potato Hunt. Given coordinates of opposing corners of a cube, it returns the names of all the systems contained within that cube.

Currently this tool is a Windows based CLI tool. The correct usage is:

RaxxlaCoordHunt.exe x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2

The exe can be found in the dist/ folder.
